# Infinite Worlde

This is a clone of [Worlde](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html), a popular word game.
The purpose of this application is solely educational.

## Technologies

The project was bootstrapped with [`create-remix`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-remix).

- Framework: [Remix](https://remix.run/docs)
- Styling: [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Development

From your terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.
